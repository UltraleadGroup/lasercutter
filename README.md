## Settings
* Any speed above 100 mm/s will have visible path deviation when changing
  direction or speed (due to inertia).
* Any speed above 130 mm/s will probably drop steps on the motors and ruin the
  design.

## Materials
As people work with materials, they can record the cut power and speeds that
worked

### MDF 5mm thick
* cutting: 70% power, 7mm/s - good cuts, some attachments and a tight fit, but worked well
* engraving: 15% power, 100mm/s 15% seems to work well (but could be made faster)

#### Other settings tested
* 100% power, 10mm/s - mostly cuts, some attachments
* 100% power, 8mm/s - mostly cuts
* 90% power, 8mm/s - mostly cuts, some attachments
* lower than 8mm/s @100% - lots of charing
