Notes on trying to reverse engineer the protocol used by this laser
cutter.

Setup
=====

Make sure you have the "usbmon" linux module inserted, then you can
startup wireshark and capture packets (current hardware configuration
has the laser cutter on the "usbmon1" port)

Capture Analysis
================

The script "extract.py" can be used to try and extract the data stream
from a usb packet capture

Usage:
    ./extract.py FILENAME > output

Example Capture files
=====================

Some example captures are included here for analysis.  The sequence
of events performed during each capture is also documented below.

capture1
--------

* turn on laser
* start capture
* start corel laser
* stop corel laser
* stop capture

capture2
--------

* start capture
* start corel laser
* open engraving dialog
* cancel engraving dialog
* stop corel laser
* stop capture

capture3
--------

* start capture
* start corel laser
* open engraving dialog
* single step right 5 times slowly
* single step up 5 times slowly
* cancel engraving dialog
* stop corel laser
* stop capture

Write to File Examples
======================
The corel laser software also has a write to file feature.  This results in
a file containing the data that would be sent to the laser cutter.

For the purpose of having a known test sample, a simple corel draw file
was created with two 10mm x 10mm squares, located at x=10mm, y=10mm and
x=10mm, y=30mm (originally only one square was used, but this seemed to
cause the software to not generate any output).  This file is saved in
this repo as "square10x10.cdr" and all the examples below use this file
as a base.

simple tests
------------

filename |  speed   | refer x | refer y
---------+----------+---------+---------
outfile1 | 10mm/s   | 10mm    | 10mm
outfile2 | 11mm/s   | 11mm    | 11mm
outfile3 | 12mm/s   | 12mm    | 12mm
outfile4 | 13mm/s   | 10mm    | 10mm
outfile5 | 10mm/s   | 14mm    | 10mm
outfile6 | 10mm/s   | 10mm    | 15mm
outfile7 |  0mm/s   | 10mm    | 10mm
outfile8 | 0.25mm/s | 10mm    | 10mm
outfile9 | 10mm/s   |  0mm    |  0mm
