Notes on trying to reverse engineer the protocol used by this laser
cutter.

Setup
=====

Make sure you have the "usbmon" linux module inserted, then you can
startup wireshark and capture packets (current hardware configuration
has the laser cutter on the "usbmon1" port)

Example Capture files
=====================

Some example captures are included here for analysis.  The sequence
of events performed during each capture is also documented below.

capture1
--------

* turn on laser
* start capture
* start corel laser
* stop corel laser
* stop capture

capture2
--------

* start capture
* start corel laser
* open engraving dialog
* cancel engraving dialog
* stop corel laser
* stop capture

capture3
--------

* start capture
* start corel laser
* open engraving dialog
* single step right 5 times slowly
* single step up 5 times slowly
* cancel engraving dialog
* stop corel laser
* stop capture
