Occasionally, we do test cuts to check how the laser works on various
materials.  It can also be used to watch out for degradation in the laser
power (as the tube gets older, the power output drops)

| Material | Datecode | Power | Raster | Vector | Cut | Remarks | Image |

| Dark plastic, 3mm thick | 1941 | 25% | 1x250 | 1x25 | 5x20 | | |
| Clear plastic, 6mm thick | 1941 | 25% | 1x250 | 1x25 | 6x10 | not quite cut through | |
