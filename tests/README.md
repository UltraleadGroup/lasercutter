Occasionally, we do test cuts to check how the laser works on various
materials.  It can also be used to watch out for degradation in the laser
power (as the tube gets older, the power output drops)

To ensure consistancy, tests are done with a specific [sample diagram](test.svg).

* *Thic* is how thick the material is (in millimeters)
* *Date* is the YYWW that the test was done
* *Pwr* is the Laser percentage power (kept the same for all three passes)
* *Rast* is the repeat count and mm/second speed for the Raster drawing pass
* *Vect* is the repeat count and mm/second speed for the Vector drawing pass
* *Cut* is the repeat count and mm/second speed for the Cut pass
