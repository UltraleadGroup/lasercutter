Occasionally, we do test cuts to check how the laser works on various
materials.  It can also be used to watch out for degradation in the laser
power (as the tube gets older, the power output drops)

* *Date* is the YYWW that the test was done
* *Pwr* is the Laser percentage power (kept the same for all three passes)
* *Rast* is the repeat count and mm/second speed for the Raster drawing pass
* *Vect* is the repeat count and mm/second speed for the Vector drawing pass
* *Cut* is the repeat count and mm/second speed for the Cut pass

| Material | Date | Pwr | Rast | Vect | Cut | Remarks | Image |
| -------- | ---- | ----- | ------ | ------ | --- | ------- | ----- |
| Dark plastic, 3mm thick | 1941 | 25% | 1x250 | 1x25 | 5x20 | | |
| Clear plastic, 6mm thick | 1941 | 25% | 1x250 | 1x25 | 6x10 | not quite cut through | |
